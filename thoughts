This paper tries to find the effects of stockholding policy in Zambia on the maize price level and volatility. The study period is Jan.2003 - Nov. 2009, when have both the market price, FRA buying/selling price and purchase quantity by district. We are comparing district maize price with FRA purchases in the same month with markets that don't have FRA purcase at all. 

The endogeneity issue at hand is multiple. First, several policies were at play and all to a certain degree endogenous to grain production and maize prices, including temporary export ban, import tariff and input subsidy program. Much of this is time variant and work on all the markets (control and treatment) alike, and can be controlled by adding in the policy variable when the policies are in place. Also by adding in the weather shocks in the previous year.

Second, the pricing and purchase quantity of the FRA is endogeous to the local prices, which can be controlled by weather shocks at the local level. Local price matters because of the incomplete infrastrature and a lack of market information system. 

The source of variation are seasonal price changes, across year production/stock changes, across year policy changes and across markets price differences within the same year. 

The identification strategy is to make use of the step by step roll out of the FRA throughout the years. The intensity of treatment is measured in terms of FRA purchase as % of smallholder maize sales at the district level, No. of districts they are buying (as it affects to the price transmission and price expectation). 

The variables of interest are maize price levels, price spread between district market and Lusaka, and coefficient of variation of district level maize price.

The model would be consisted of a structural VAR with one equation as the price to policy and weather, and one equation as the policy to price. But esitmate the equation with a reduced form using OLS. a test between a structural break VAR and a linear VAR

test for threshold 


#### Spatial model : more markets

Use annual data instead of monthly 

Focus consumer price during the lean seasons

consider temporary export ban too 

foucs on the FRA sales effect: how it decreases its spatial lag due to cost

partial control 

differentiate the effect 

model: differnetiate the FRA buying and selling effect

use a road-distance based, continous treatment effect 

effects on previous year's FRA purchase 



apart from the FRA sales, also need to consider the exports and imports 
 
 
 FRA purchase months: 6-10,
 FRA sales month: 12-4 , sold at the nearest district market, so no distance measure is needed.
 
 Lean Season 2-4 

1. Panel regression

Price_lean - Price_year_average = imports_t-1 * distance + FRA_sales_t +  FRA_purchase t_1 (locally) + annual stock +
weather_i,t-1


FRA purchase price , the same through out the year 




## theoretical model 

a government 

sell low during season and buy high during lean season
