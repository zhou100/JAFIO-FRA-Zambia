## Effects of Stock holding policy on Maize Prices: Evidence from Zambia


**Abstract**: Public stockholding programs are prevalent, and have recently gained traction, particularly in developing countries.  Governments directly purchase and store staple grains, usually intending to stabilize price for both producers and consumers. Despite the massive spending on stockholding programs, little is known about their effectiveness in mitigating the retail price swings associated with production shocks. This paper estimates the effects of the purchase and sales activities of the Food Reserve Agency (FRA) on maize market prices across more than thirty markets in Zambia using monthly price data from 2003 to 2008. To deal with the endogeneity in purchase and sales, we use predicted FRA purchase and sales targets as instrumental variables. Controlling for other policies in place, we find evidence that FRA activities stabilize retail prices in the major district markets from annual swings. Results also show that FRA purchases raise local prices for surplus maize producers for about 3% on average during the time of harvest and FRA sales help to lower the price during the lean season up to 7%.
