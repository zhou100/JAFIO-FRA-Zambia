This archive contains the data and model code needed to replicate main results for 

ÒTHE EFFECTS OF THE FOOD RESERVE AGENCY ON MAIZE MARKET PRICES IN ZAMBIAÓ 

by Nicole M. Mason and Robert J. Myers.

Using Stata, open the do-file <Mason_&_Myers_Stata_code.do>, which uses the Stata data file <FRA_effects_on_market_prices_dataset.dta>. This do-file contains the preliminary testing results (unit roots and lag order), as well as the linear VAR estimation, impulse response, Òno FRAÓ simulation, and robustness check results.  

Threshold estimation and testing were done in GAUSS. In GAUSS, open the code file <Mason_&_Myers_GAUSS_code.prg>. This program uses the GAUSS data file <Mason_&_Myers_dataset_for_GAUSS.csv>.

Code for Òno FRAÓ simulations for the threshold VARs supported by Hansen tests is included in the Stata do-file above, <Mason_&_Myers_Stata_code.do>.
